    If the file is a symlink not related to the dotfile repo
    then the source of the symlink will be added. The original path will
    be symlinked to the versioned file.

    If the source file is a child of an already added directory it will
    be added as part of the directory. If the source file is a child of
    a directory that has not been added it will be installed
    individually, with the parents recreated, if they do not already
    exist.

    If the source file is a directory then only the directory will be
    added, unless there are child files that have already been added, in
    which case they will be unlinked and added to version control under
    the source.

    Changes will be committed.
